# [SMU-Net: Style matching U-Net for brain tumor segmentation with missing modalities](https://openreview.net/forum?id=X5H_eVaqtb)

In this research work, we propose a style matching U-Net to address the missing modality challenge for brain tumour segmentation on MRI modalities. The proposed Style matching mechanism decomposes the representational space into content and style representation and then uses conceptual loss to enforce knowledge distillation in a co-training strategy.
